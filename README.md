#  Star Wars Quotes Slideshow

## Overview

Simple slideshow app created with Swift's Storyboard and UIKit

## Description

This app was coded to show my ability to start out a new project, write features with 
a basic spec and design, and write clean code. This application follows the MVC structure.
I made sure to make the data scalable so if one were to add more quotes to the JSON data, 
the app would still function properly.

## Breakdown

* Decode an included JSON file to usable Swift data
* Load data into view
* Present data in an automated slideshow format
* Loop slideshow

Each slide will have it's own author, quote, and a picture that I added. Each slide will
also present itself for a specific amount of time in order to read the entire quote.
